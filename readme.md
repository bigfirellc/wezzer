# Wezzer.py

## Synopsis

Wezzer is a dead simple app to get pull local weather information based on your geolocation and print it to the terminal with some nice formatting. It was born of frustration with weather websites being full of ads, and just generally garbage to look at and navigate.


## Example

Just install and run Wezzer on any system that has Python 2.x to get a brief look into your local weather.
